## Contributions

This project was quite a challenge for me and I received  a great deal of assistance from the Xpert Learning Assistant tool available through my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp account. This tool helped guide me through some difficulties with set up, conditional logic and evaluating code quality. I also was inspired by the code created in the activities in the coursework which helped provide guidance on file and code structure. 

I also received assistance from my tutor for this project (name can be noted once permission is granted) to help evalaute my code and help me connect to mogoDB.
